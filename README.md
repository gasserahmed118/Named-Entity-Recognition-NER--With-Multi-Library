    Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Multi-Library Implementation
        1. Overview
           This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using multiple popular NLP libraries:
              1. spaCy – Fast and robust entity recognition
              2. NLTK – Traditional NER with POS tagging and chunking
              3. Hugging Face Transformers – State-of-the-art transformer-based NER
              4. Stanza (Stanford NLP) – High-quality multi-language NER
            The project includes English and Arabic examples, supports custom entity addition, and is ready for exploratory analysis and NLP pipelines.

      2. Objectives
         1. Understand how NER works with different NLP libraries
         2. Compare outputs from spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face, and Stanza
         3. Demonstrate usage on both short and long texts
         4. Provide reusable functions for entity extraction and visualization
         5. Include Arabic NER examples
         6. Prepare a GitHub-ready codebase for NLP projects

     3. Features
         1. Unified NER interface to run all libraries on any text
         2. Custom entity addition in spaCy
         3. Arabic NER examples included
         4. Noun chunk extraction in spaCy
         5. Ready for text analysis pipelines and feature engineering 

     4. Applications
         1. Information extraction
         2. Chatbots & conversational AI
         3. Text summarization
         4. Resume parsing
         5. Legal and financial text analysis
         6. Multilingual entity recognition

    5. Limitations
          1. spaCy English model only supports basic Arabic tokenization (limited accuracy)
          2. NLTK requires multiple downloads (maxent_ne_chunker_tab)
          3. Transformer-based models are resource-intensive
          4. Stanza may take longer to initialize
